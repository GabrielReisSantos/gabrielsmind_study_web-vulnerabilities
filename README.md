# Web Vulnerabilities (Gabrielsmind)

Practical, copy‑paste study repo for three core **web vulns** with deep coverage:
- `command-injection/`
- `sql-injection/`
- `xss/`

> **Legal**: Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to assess.

Quick setup:
```bash
export target=https://example.com
```

**Folders**
- `command-injection/` — payload shapes, blind CI, encodings, bypasses, automation, prevention
- `sql-injection/` — error/boolean/time/UNION, enumeration, sqlmap recipes, WAF bypasses, prevention
- `xss/` — reflected/stored/DOM, contexts, polyglots, evasion, tooling, CSP & dev fixes
- `common/` — helpful headers for curl, wordlists, payload lists for Intruder, tiny utilities
- `scripts/` — small Bash helpers (enumeration sweeps, fuzzing loops)

All examples use **`$target`** so you can change targets once.
